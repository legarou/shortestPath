# shortestPath
## Library
Download the latest version of the shortestPath library here or check the releases: https://github.com/legarou/shortestPath/releases/download/v1.0.0/shortestpath-1.0.jar

## Requirements
- min. Java 16

## Setup
1. Add the library to your project as an external JAR file
2. Import the org.shortestpath
3. Use the ShortestPathManager for easy access

## Example
An example can be found under: https://github.com/legarou/ConsoleShortestPath

##	Shortest Path Manager Usage
To use the library and the shortest path program ideally, use the shortest path manager.
The algorthms implemented are the Dijkstra algorithm and the FLoyd-Warshall algorithm.

   Create an instance of the ShortestPathManger using:
   
    new ShortestPathManager()

The shortest path manager contains instances of the file service, the algorithm service, and the profile.
It has the following methods:

- setProfile:  
requires 
    - useElevator (booealn), boolean 
    - useStairs (boolean)
    - goOutside (boolean) 
    - alternatePath (boolean) 
    - algorithm, can be "DIJKSTRA" or "FLOYD_WARSHALL"

- setProfileAlgorithm:  
requires the algorhtm name, can be "DIJKSTRA" or "FLOYD_WARSHALL"

- readProfile:  
Tries to read the profile settigns from the profile.txt file  
Returns true or false based on success

- printBuilding:  
Prints all nodes of the building is has read and built previously.

- getBuilding:  
Returns the building in form of a HashMap with the node name as the key and the node as the element

- shortestPathWithOwnProfile / shortestPathWithNewProfile:  
requires either the name of the start nod and the end node  
or  
requires both, as well as the values for the new profile setup  
(boolean useElevator, boolean useStairs, boolean goOutside, boolean alternatePath, String algorithm)

- readBuilding:  
requires the path to a txt or csv file with the building
To use your own building, the building has to prepared in either a txt or csv file.  
The first line is ignored. Each line should contain one point of the building with:  
  - name (muste be unique, as it serves as the nodeâ€™s id)  
  - node type (door, room, stairs, elevator, or path)  
  - leads outside value (true or false)  
  - a list of all neighbors and their distances to the node  
The list of neighbors consists of the name, which is the id of the node, and a number representing the distance from the neighboring node to the current node.  
These four properties are separated by a semicolon.  

The first two lines of the building file might look like this:  

    name;type;leads outside;neigbours (name + distance)
    A0.03 Treppe;STAIRS;FALSE;A0.03 Seitenausgang,3,A0.03 Haupteingang,13,A0.15 Lift,21
